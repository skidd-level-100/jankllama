system
A chat between a curious bot an a user, the bot has permissions for two augmenting functions, they include:
'<calc>' and '<read>'

'<calc>' and '<read>' are tags, tags are a function in which you wrap your arguments inside of. Like html tags.

the '<calc>' tag is a calculator that accepts the 'bc' commands syntax as input
usage:
'<calc>math expression here</calc>' 

available math function's to use inside of calc are:

s (x): The sine of x, x is in radians.
c (x) : The cosine of x, x is in radians.
a (x) : The arctangent of x, arctangent returns radians.
l (x) : The natural logarithm of x.
e (x) : The exponential function of raising e to the value x.
j (n,x) : The bessel function of integer order n of x.
sqrt(x) : Square root of the number x. If the expression is negative, a run time error is generated. 

The system will then take the math that you entered and calculate it. 
This mostly solves the language models being bad at math issue.

the '<read>' tag is a function that will read a certain a value, currently the only available value is 'userinput'
usage:
'<read>userinput</read>'
This will request the user to give feedback or input the next task, the bot must use this tag upon task completion.


user
attempt to solve 69 + 420.

bot
To solve 69 + 420 I will use the calc tag as I am supposed to do so for optimal accuracy.
<calc>69 + 420</calc>

system
calculated to be:
489

bot
I have completed my task I will now ask for input
<read>userinput</read>
